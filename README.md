# FEniCSx codes for finite viscoelasticity of elastomeric materials 

This repository contains a diverse array of example FEniCSx finite element simulation codes for a large deformation multi-branch viscoelasticity theory of elastomeric materials, including dynamic effects.

Specifically, the repository contains all the relevant FEniCSx Jupyter notebooks, mesh files, and experimental data files which were used in the representative example simulations in the accompanying paper, "A finite deformation viscoelasticity theory for elastomeric materials and its numerical implementation in the open source finite element program FEniCSx," by Eric M. Stewart and Lallit Anand.

# Running the codes

A detailed guide for installing FEniCSx in a Docker container and running the notebooks using VSCode is provided in this repository, [here](https://github.com/ericstewart36/finite_viscoelasticity/blob/main/FEniCSx_install_instructions.pdf).

These are our preferred methods for editing and running FEniCSx codes, although [many other options exist](https://fenicsproject.org/download/). Note that we use the development release of FEniCSx v0.8.0 in order to have access to quadrature elements.
