# FEniCSx codes for finite viscoelasticity of elastomeric materials 

This repository contains the code base for the finite element implementation of the large deformation viscoelasticity theory I developed in collaboration with Prof. Lallit Anand for modeling elastomeric materials.

Specifically, the repository contains all the relevant FEniCSx codes, mesh files, and experimental data files which were used in the representative example simulations in the accompanying paper, "A finite deformation viscoelasticity theory for elastomeric materials and its numerical implementation in the open source finite element program FEniCSx."

# Running the codes

A detailed guide for installing FEniCSx in a Docker container and running the notebooks using VSCode is provided in this repository, [here](https://github.com/ericstewart36/finite_viscoelasticity/blob/main/FEniCSx_install_instructions.pdf).

These are our preferred methods for editing and running FEniCSx codes, although [many other options exist](https://fenicsproject.org/download/). Note that we use the development release of FEniCSx v0.8.0 in order to have access to quadrature elements.
